## Jigsaws

Here you can find some models of jigsaw puzzles in CAD. There are 11 sizes: 1 Piece, 2 pieces, 4 pieces, 6 pieces, 12 pieces, 24 pieces, 48 pieces, 96 pieces, 144 pieces, 216 pieces, 432 pieces, and 576 pieces. In addition to this, there are frames for each puzzle. There are .STEP and .STL files for each model. They will be plain, and you will need to modify it if you need a picture on it. Here's the link to the page: https://makerworld.com/en/models/590988. All the pieces are 1 milimeter thick, and the frames have a 2.5 milimeter border on all directions, making the final size of the frame 5 milimeters bigger in the X and Y axes. In that, there is a 1 milimeter indentation that perfectly fits the jigsaw puzzle. Below that, it is 4 milimeters thicker, and on the extra size in the X and Y axes, it is 5 milimeters in depth.
